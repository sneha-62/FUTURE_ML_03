# FUTURE_ML_03
📌 Resume Screening System using ML

🔹 Objective

To build a Machine Learning model that screens resumes, compares them with a job description, ranks candidates based on relevance, and identifies missing skills.

🔹 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Cosine Similarity

🔹 Workflow

Loaded resume dataset (CSV format)

Cleaned and preprocessed resume text

Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Compared resumes with job description

Calculated similarity scores

Ranked candidates in descending order

Identified missing required skills

🔹 Output

The system displays:

Candidate ID

Resume Category

Similarity Score

Missing Skills

Higher similarity score indicates better match to the job role.

🔹 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NLP techniques like TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity can automate resume screening and candidate ranking efficiently.
